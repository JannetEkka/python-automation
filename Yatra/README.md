Test Strategy for Travel Website

Objective: A Hybrid Driven framework approach using Selenium and Python
    
In Scope: Verification of Search Flights feature (without Login) and filter by stops functionality 

Customer workflows:
    Steps to reproduce:
        1. Launch browser and open website (i.e, Yatra)
        2. from location
        3. to location
        4. departure date
        5. flight search button
        6. filter flight by stop
        7. verify filtered results have 'x' stop flights
    
Important Packages and Modules used:
    1. Selenium 
    2. Selenium WebDriver
    3. Logging
    4. PyTest
    5. PyTest_html
    6. Softest
    7. ddt
    8. OpenPyXl
    9. Inspect
    10. Time
    11. OS

Focus Areas:
- Functional correctness of flows
- UI/navigation 
- Execution Reports and Screenshots on failure
- Execution Logs
- Easy to maintain and better readability
- POM structure 
- External test data files
- Compatibility 
- browsers, devices, OS 
- Usability - ease of use, accessibility 

Approach: 
- Hybrid Driven Automation Framework development with POM model and data-driven.
- Conventionally robust project structure
- Automated test cases using Selenium and Python 
- Cross browser compatibility testing on Edge, Chrome, Firefox - Ease of use evaluation.

Deliverables:
- Functional test cases and execution reports  
- Test coverage and failure reports with screenshots
- Refactored code for future test suites and collections development.

Entry & Exit Criteria User stories : to be tested, must meet the defined 'Ready for Testing' criteria. 
Testing completes when all test cases execute with no critical defects outstanding. 

Risks: 
- Open Source
- Lack of QA environment
